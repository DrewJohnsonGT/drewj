The goal of this project was to create a cross platform web and mobile app for
simulating 2D N-body gravitational systems. <br/>The app is based on the 3-Body
Problem, a classic problem in physics and mathematics that has no general
analytical solution.

I'm a big fan of the book series by Cixin Liu,
<ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past">

and the 3-Body Problem is a central theme in the series. I wanted to create a
tool that would allow users to create and simulate their own 3+ body systems.

One of my goals was to simualate some of the stable 3 body systems. With some
careful math I was able to provide a few template systems for users to explore,
such as this figure 8 system:

The app is very customizable and allows users to create their own systems with
varrying parameters.
