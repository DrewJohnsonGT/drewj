title: Hue Highway
description:
  Simple PWA built right before a long roadtrip for a passenger to track the
  frequency of semi-trucks on the highway. The app is a simple counter that
  increments each time a semi-truck is spotted. The data is stored in local
  storage and persists between sessions.

number of semi-trucks you see...
